# Customer-Churn-Predictions
# Introduction
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The companies are interested 
in identifying segments of these customers because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one. 
For example, if Netflix knew a segment of customers who were at risk of churning they could proactively engage them with special offers 
instead of simply losing them.

Simply put, customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service. Also known as customer
attrition, customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new
customers – earning business from new customer’s means working leads all the way through the sales funnel, utilizing your marketing and 
sales resources throughout the process. Customer retention, on the other hand, is generally more cost-effective as you’ve already earned 
the trust and loyalty of existing customers.

Customer churn impedes growth, so companies should have a defined method for calculating customer churn in a given period of time. By
being aware of and monitoring churn rate, organizations are equipped to determine their customer retention success rates and identify 
strategies for improvement.

Various organizations calculate customer churn rate in a variety of ways, as churn rate may represent the total number of customers lost, 
the percentage of customers lost compared to the company’s total customer count, the value of recurring business lost, or the per cent of 
recurring value lost. Other organizations calculate churn rate for a certain period of time, such as quarterly periods or fiscal years.
One of the most commonly used methods for calculating customer churn is to divide the total number of clients a company has at the
beginning of a specified time period by the number of customers lost during the same period.
